Question 1
No twins pls !!!: Mr. Chitti, a robot is assigned a job of reporting to his boss Dr. Vaseegaran
about the existence of twins in a group. Chittiâ€™s job is just to report whether the group is distinct 
or not. Even if one duplicate is present then the group is not unique. Help Mr. Chitti to report. 
Input: an array of integers 
output: Array distinct / Array not distinct
Example: Consider the following array. The array is not distinct as 10 is duplicated.

#include <stdio.h>
int countDistinct(int a[], int n)      
{
   int i, j, count = 1;
   
   for (i = 1; i < n; i++)      
   {
      for (j = 0; j < i; j++)   
      {
         if (a[i] == a[j])    
         {
            break;            
         }
      }
      if (i == j)
      {
         count++;    
      }
   }
   return count;      
}
int main()
{
    int n;       
    printf("Enter the number of elements \n");
    scanf("%d",&n);   

    int a[n];   
    printf("Enter the array elements : ");
    for (int i=0;i<n;i++)
    scanf("%d",&a[i]);   

    int c= countDistinct(a,n);       
    printf("The number of distinct elements are %d",c);   
    return 0;
}
